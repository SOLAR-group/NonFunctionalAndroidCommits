AutoName: Gmote
Description: |-
    Gmote turns Android into a remote control for a computer, allowing users to run
    movies and music at a distance. It supports all of the standard remote control
    features such as play, pause, rewind, volume controls etc. It also has a
    built-in file browser that lets you select what to play. Some typical use-cases
    are people launching and controlling movies while sitting back on their couch,
    or listening to music.

    It also has a touch pad feature which allows you to control your mouse from the
    phone, similar to a laptop touchpad (also sending keystrokes typed in on the
    phone to the computer). It's great for sitting back on the couch while watching
    youtube or hulu.
