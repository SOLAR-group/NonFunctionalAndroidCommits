Description: |-
    InTheClear is a suite of mobile applications designed to keep users safer in
    difficult situations by using their phone's built-in tools. At its core are two
    main features: Emergency SMS and Data Wipe. At installation, InTheClear walks a
    new user through the process of configuring each of these features. The user can
    then activate either Emergency SMS or Data Wipe individually, on an ad-hoc
    basis. In addition, they can simultaneously activate *both* Emergency SMS and
    Data Wipe via Panic!, a simple, one-touch feature of InTheClear.
