AutoName: Binary Kitchen Doorlock
Description: |
    "We are proud to present the next generation of the revolutionary way to unlock the door of the Binary Kitchen hackspace.

    Some usage notes:
    * The app allows for automatic WiFi switching. If activated, newer Android versions (Oreo and upwards) require coarse grained location permissions. Otherwise SSID can not be read.
    * Settings screen won't disappear unless user provided username & password
    * The app contains a widget -- the space widget. It remotely shows if the space is open. A click on the button will update it.
    * Please file bug reports on https://github.com/Binary-Kitchen/doorlock-app

    Good quality... No fake! Contains 50 metric tons of finest software engineering.
