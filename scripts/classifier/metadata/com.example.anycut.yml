AutoName: Any Cut
Description: |-
    You can make shortcuts for anything that has an activity e.g Android keyboard
    settings screen. All activities are listed but there is no description of what
    each does, so youâ€™ll just have to take a guess and some may not do anything. In
    addition you can make shortcuts to directly dial or send an sms to a contact.

    This app is ancient so it may not work on Android 4+ but you can get direct
    access to app activities with https://f-droid.org/packages/com.ideasfrombrain.search_based_launcher_v2.
