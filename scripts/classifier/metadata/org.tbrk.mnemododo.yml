AutoName: Mnemododo
Description: |-
    Mnemododo allows cards from Mnemosyne (a spaced-repetition flash-card program)
    to be reviewed.

    Mnemododo does not replace Mnemosyne: cards are still added, edited, and deleted
    using a desktop or laptop computer.

    Rather, cards for several days are exported using the Mnemogogo plugin and then
    transferred to a mobile phone where they can be reviewed on the go. When those
    cards have been reviewed, they are imported back into Mnemosyne, and more cards
    may be exported.
