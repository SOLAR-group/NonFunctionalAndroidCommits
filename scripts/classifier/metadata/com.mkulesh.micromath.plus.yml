AutoName: microMathematics Plus
Description: |-
    With microMathematics Plus, not only can you perform mathematical calculations
    in naturally readable form but you can also create and manage your own
    collection of interactive formulas!

    microMathematics Plus is a revolutionary new kind of mobile calculator. It is a
    scientific graphing calculator and function plotter on Android oriented around a
    worksheet. It features live editing of mathematical identities combined with
    highly accurate computations.

    This app is not only for students. Anyone who enjoys mathematics or requires
    more than just a basic calculator will benefit from microMathematics' amazing
    calculations and plotting.
