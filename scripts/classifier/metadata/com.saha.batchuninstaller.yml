AutoName: Batch Uninstaller
Description: |-
    Batch Uninstaller allows you to uninstall multiple apps at once. If root
    permission is not available, you can still delete multiple apps a lot quicker
    than you can using the native android implementation. However, you will be
    prompted for each app uninstalled. Non Root users can not uninstall system apps.
    This is a limitation with the Android Operating system.
