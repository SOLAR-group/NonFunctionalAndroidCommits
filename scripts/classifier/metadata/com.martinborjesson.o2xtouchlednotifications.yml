Name: LG Touch LED
AutoName: LG Notifications
Description: |-
    For:

    * LG Optimus 2X/T-Mobile G2X/Star (P990/P999/SU660)
    * LG Optimus Black (P970)
    * LG Optimus 3D (P920)

    This application uses mainly the touch LED buttons to show if there is any
    missed notifications by turning them on and off. Vibrator and notification
    ringtones are supported. It is enabled by default and will autostart on boot but
    has to be run once after installation to start the service.

    May require root: it depends on the phone.
