AutoName: Change Detection
Description: |-
    ''Change Detection'' tracks changes on websites you otherwise would visit
    frequently to see if there is something new. Use cases:

    * Teacher says grades will be published "soon", but no one knows what "soon" means and you are tired of reloading.
    * You are working with a server and wants to know the result from a request, periodically.
    * You are waiting for updates on an Exam, like if something was postponed or updated.
    * You want to monitor the Dagger documentation to see when Thermosiphonâ€™s explanation improves.
