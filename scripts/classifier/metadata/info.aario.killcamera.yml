AutoName: Kill Camera
Description: |-
    Kill camera related processes. This is useful when you get the famous error
    message "Can't connect to camera" or similar. You tap on KILL button. Once the
    camera service killed, it should be automatically restarted by the system. So
    you don't need to restart your device just to take a photo and therefor loose
    the opportunity!
