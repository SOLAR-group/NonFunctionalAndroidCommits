AutoName: Cricket's Alarm
Description: |-
    A widget for keeping track of a petâ€™s medications.

    This is a simple widget timer that rings an alarm to remind me to give
    Cricket (my diabetic tortie) a shot of insulin. By default the alarm rings
    after 12 hours. It can be 'snoozed' for an hour.
