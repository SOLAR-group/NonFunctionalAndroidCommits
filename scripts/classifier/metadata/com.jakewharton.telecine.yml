Name: Telecine
Description: |-
    Capture full resolution videos directly on your phone. No more recording
    controls cluttering up the video or USB debugging notification in your status
    bar! Launch the overlay and then navigate away from the app. The overlay will
    remain allowing you to press record when you are in the target app. The overlay
    disappears while recording. To stop, press the area where the overlay used to be
    (hint: it's still there! just transparent)

    TL;DR: Press record, press the same area to stop.
