AutoName: Bats! HIIT
Description: |-
    Bats! HIIT is a simple but useful High Intensity Interval Training timer.

    '''Workout structure'''

    A HIIT workout with Bats! HIIT comprises a sequence of alternating rest (warm
    up/cool down) intervals and work blocks. For example, a workout with two workout
    blocks will look like

    1) warm up 2) block #1 3) rest 4) block #2 5)cool down

    Bats! HIIT always inserts rest intervals between blocks, and always includes a
    warm up and cool down interval.

    The length of the rest interval is configurable. By default, it is 60 seconds.

    '''Block structure'''

    A block is a series of work/break interval pairs; each work interval has a
    corresponding break interval. For example, you might configure Bats! HIIT to
    include 4 work intervals per block, with a 50 second work interval and 10 second
    break. Such a block would take 4 minutes.

    '''Audio and visual cues'''

    Bats! HIIT always gives a warning consisting of 4 short chirps when you're about
    to transition to a new interval. Every work interval begins with a single
    high-pitched beep; break intervals begin with a descending, two-tone beep. Rest
    intervals do not have an initial beep.

    During work intervals, your phone's screen will be green. In breaks, the screen
    will turn yellow. Rest is indicated by a red background. Your phone will also
    tell you how long is left in the present sub-interval and how many work/break
    pairs and blocks remain.

    '''Screen lock'''

    When you're exercising, you want to be able to see your progress without
    unlocking your screen. Bats! HIIT prevents your screen from turning off, though
    it does allow it to dim for power savings. This lets you know at a glance how
    you're doing. Save/recall workout

    You can save/recall/delete stored workouts. "Last workout" is automatically
    created whenever you do a workout, and is restored when the app is next started.

    '''Pause workout'''

    If Bats! HIIT loses focus during a workout, your workout will be paused and will
    resume when Bats! HIIT resumes. Delay locked loop

    To ensure that your workout is accurately timed, Bats! HIIT implements a
    feedback system called a delay-locked loop. Every second, when Bats! HIIT wakes
    up to update the timer readout, it measures how long it was actually asleep and
    adjusts future delay intervals to hit the target 1-second sleep interval. In
    practice, this reduces short-term timing errors from more than 5% to about 0.2%;
    since the error is integrated over the life of your workout, the overall
    accuracy is two to three orders of magnitude better than the short-term errors.
