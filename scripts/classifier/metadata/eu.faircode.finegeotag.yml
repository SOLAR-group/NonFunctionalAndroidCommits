Description: |-
    '''Note:''' This app is no longer maintained.

    Automatically geotag photos with a real-time location right after they are
    taken. The camera application mostly uses the last known location, which could
    be old and miles away from your current position. FineGeotag will try to acquire
    an accurate location in real-time and update the Exif location tags of the
    photos taken. FineGeotag will try to use the GPS and/or the network location,
    depending on which location providers are enabled in the Android settings.
    Optionally a popup will be shown with a thumbnail of the photo and the reverse
    geocoded address. Donâ€™t forget to disable geotagging of your camera application
    to prevent interference.
