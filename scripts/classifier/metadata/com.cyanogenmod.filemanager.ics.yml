AutoName: File Manager
Description: |-
    '''NOTE:''' This app is no longer maintained, its repo was archived.

    A backport of the CyanogenMod File Manager application to ICS and higher. This
    is an unofficial fork of the main CyanogenMod File Manager project.

    Requires root: No. By default you can’t access /data or /system but that can be
    changed by choosing a different security access mode in the General preferences.
    Then root will be called for if you try to change something that normally can’t
    be.
