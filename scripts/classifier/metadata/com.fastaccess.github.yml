Summary: A GitHub client app built from ground up
Description: |-
    '''Warning:''' Upstream deleted fdroid flavor with some strange reasoning.
    Locked/deleted comments, general attitude suggest FastHub is gone forever.
    You could try its fork https://f-droid.org/packages/com.fastaccess.github.libre instead.
