    Please note:

    This app is designed to control Crazyflie and Crazyflie 2.x. It requires

    Bluetooth LE. Do not pair the Crazyflie via Bluetooth settings!

    Distributors for Crazyflie and Crazyradio can be found on our distributor
    list: [http://www.bitcraze.se/distributors/]

    How to use the bootloader:

    # The list of firmwares should automatically be filled (make sure you have a network connection!)
    # Select a firmware (make sure you select the right one depending on which Crazyflie you want to update (CF1 or CF2))
    # Flash firmware (For Crazyflie 1, click on "Flash firmware" and switch on the Crazyflie during the next 10 seconds. For Crazyflie 2, press the ON/OFF switch of the Crazyflie longer than 1.5 second until one blue LED blinks. Then release the button and both blue LEDs should blink. Then click on "Flash firmware")
    # After a successful flash the Crazyflie will automatically restart in firmware mode and is ready to use.

    It’s nearly impossible to brick the Crazyflie. In case of any problems during flashing, you can always try again or use the PC client to re-flash.

    Permissions:

    * Photo/Media/Files: This is required to save the firmware files on the device.
    * Bluetooth connection information: This is required for connecting to Crazyflie 2.x over Bluetooth.
    * Location: This is required for Bluetooth LE scanning since Android 6.0.
