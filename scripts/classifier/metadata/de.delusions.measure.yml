Summary: Weight tracker
Description: |-
    Droid Weight is a simple, easy to use, weight tracking app that helps you keep a
    journal of your weight on your device. Besides weight, allows to track few other
    body parameters. Calculates BMI (Body Mass Index). Draws graphs of parameters
    across the time. Allows to enter a value just for current date/time (not what
    measured yesterday and forgot to add), but supports CSV import/export.
