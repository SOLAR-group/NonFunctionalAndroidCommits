AutoName: ShellsMP
Description: |-
    This program gives an opportunity to play a Shells game with your friends. Only
    multiplayer mode is supported, so you will need 2 devices: one for thimblerigger
    and another one for the victim. Devices should be connected to the same WiFi
    network segment.

    If you are thimblerigger - start the game, wait for the victim, put ball and few
    cups then move cups.

    If you are victim - connect the game, watch and guess.

    Source code gives an example how following techonologies can be used:

    * Android NSD for device discovery
    * OpenGL text rendering
    * OpenGL ball rendering
    * OpenGL shadows rendering
    * JS-Collider: Java network framework <a href="https://github.com/js-labs/js-collider">JS-Collider</a>
