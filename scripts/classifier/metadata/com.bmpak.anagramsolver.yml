Description: |-
    Find anagrams for any given word INSTANTLY!

    A word or phrase formed by reordering the letters of another word or phrase,
    such as "garden" to "danger", is called an anagram. One word anagrams (where a
    single word is anagrammed into another single word) are sometimes referred to by
    wordplay specialists as transpositions. For example, "listen" is a transposition
    of "silent".

    You can type a regular or a scrambled word and see all the possible
    combinations. Come up with a word and let the app find all the possible
    anagrams. Browsing through random anagrams is a fun option! You can also use the
    app as a spelling dictionary.
