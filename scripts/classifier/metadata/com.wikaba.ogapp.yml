AutoName: Ogame on Android
Description: |-
    Playing Ogame on a mobile browser eats up a lot of memory, which makes
    performance on lower-end devices horrible. This ongoing project aims to provide
    a client for Ogame which would cut down on memory usage while playing the game.

    At the current moment, this application can only view events from the overview
    screen. Not all mission types are properly identified, but all missions will
    show up on the screen.

    This application is a third-party application for Ogame. This application is
    '''NOT''' an official tool from Gameforge.
