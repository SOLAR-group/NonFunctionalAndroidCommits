AutoName: F-Droid Basic
Summary: the new, simple test version of app store you know and love
Description: |
    This is a test version of a stripped down version of the full F-Droid
    user experience.  It is looking for maintainers, so if you want this
    to become an official thing, then get involved!

    F-Droid is an installable catalogue of FOSS (Free and Open Source
    Software) applications for the Android platform. The client makes it
    easy to browse, install, and keep track of updates on your device.

    It connects to any F-Droid compatible repositories. The default repo
    is hosted at f-droid.org, which contains only bona fide Free and Open
    Source Software.
