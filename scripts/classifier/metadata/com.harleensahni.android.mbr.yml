AutoName: Media Button Router
Description: |-
    In android, app writers decide what priority they get when receiving media
    buttons (pause/play, previous, next, etc). This can be frustrating to users if
    they want to use a different app to handle these button presses on their
    Bluetooth devices.

    This app attempts to alleviate these pains by providing hands-free selection of
    the app you want to use to handle media buttons through text-to-speech and use
    of the previous, next, and play buttons for selection.
