AutoName: IntentRadio
Description: |-
    Intent Radio is an android internet radio app without a graphical user
    interface. It is controlled exclusively through the delivery of broadcast
    intents. If you do not know what a broadcast intent is, then this is probably
    not the app for you.

    Intent Radio was written primarily to be driven by shortcuts, tasks and events
    triggered from other apps.

    Despite its name, Intent Radio will happily play any audio media supported
    natively by Android, including local content.

    '''Important:''' You must run the app manually at least once before Android will
    deliver broadcast intents. This is an Android security feature. Thereafter, even
    after reboots, it should not be necessary to run the app at all.
