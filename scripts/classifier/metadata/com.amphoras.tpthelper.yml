AutoName: TPT Helper
Description: |-
    TPT Helper is designed for the ZTE phones. It helps you to easily repartition
    the phone and for the ZTE Blade, convert it to the Gen 2 memory layout to let
    you run the latest custom ROMs. ZTE phones supported so far are the ZTE Blade
    alias Orange San Francisco, ZTE Skate alias Orange Monte Carlo and the Orange
    San Francisco II alias T-Mobile Vivacity.

    Warning: TPTs can be dangerous and could permanently brick your phone. Only use
    files designed for your phone, and always follow the in-app instructions. When
    you flash a TPT, all your data will be wiped. Make a backup first.
