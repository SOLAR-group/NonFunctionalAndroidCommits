AutoName: Etheric Synthesizer
Description: |-
    Etheric Synthesizer (EtherSynth) is a theremin-like synthesizer which allows you
    to play otherworldly melody by swiping finger on device's screen. However, it is
    not aimed at realistically imitating a real theremin as it only uses single
    finger to play.

    Features:

    * Play tones with single finger.
    * Colored gradient background guide (can be turned off).
    * Visible touch indicator (can be turned off).
    * Configurable frequency range.
    * Configurable control axes orientation and locking.
    * Configurable output waveform: sine, triangle, sawtooth, and square.
    * Configurable output audio resolution.
    * Performance could be recorded in WAVE format.
