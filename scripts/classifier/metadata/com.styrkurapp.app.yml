    Styrkur is an easy to use, yet powerful tool to track your workout. Set up your
    own workout plan or use one of our predefined.

    did the last time. With a built in timer you have full control over both your
    sets and your pauses.

    You get simple ways of keeping track of your progress. Styrkur offers both an
    simple list of your past sessions with your comments, and graphical view of your
    progress.

    Track your measurements, weight and muscle gain with a simple and charts.
