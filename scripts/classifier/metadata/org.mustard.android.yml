Description: |-
    '''The versions here donâ€™t work with Twitter or identi.ca any more'''. They only
    work with GNU Social (formerly StatusNet). You may like to try
    https://f-droid.org/packages/org.mariotaku.twidere or https://f-droid.org/packages/org.andstatus.app, for Twitter; or
    https://f-droid.org/packages/org.macno.puma for identi.ca.

    Mustard is a full-featured client for <a href="http://status.net">Statusnet</a> / GNU
    Social, a microblogging platform somewhat like Twitter, but decentralized. Note
    that the hitherto largest Statusnet site, <a href="http://identi.ca">identi.ca</a>, now uses
    a different platform called <a href="http://pump.io">pump.io</a>.

    It has many features like attachments, geolocation and avatar update. It
    supports tags, groups and public timelines, favor/disfavor notices,
    subscribe/unsubscribe users and multiple accounts.

    If the server uses OAuth the credentials will need to be put on a server as
    explained on the website.
