Description: |-
    It is really simple decision maker toy. It uses random numbers. It is better
    than flipping a coin, because it has more options. The usage is very simple. You
    need to have a specific question in mind, for which it is difficult for you to
    take a solution. After that, just hit the roll button and observe the result.
