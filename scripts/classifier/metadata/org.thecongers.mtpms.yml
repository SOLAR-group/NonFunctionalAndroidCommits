AutoName: mTPMS
Description: |-
    Read tire pressure sensors of a motorcycle with an iTPMSystem.

    Features:

    * Displays tire pressure, temperature and voltage
    * User configurable units for pressure and temperature
    * User configurable notifications for low/high tire pressure (Sound, vibrate and LED)
    * Auto night mode (dark color scheme) using the light sensor
    * Sensor discovery
    * Screen rotation
    * Runs in the background
    * Optional data logging in csv format to /sdcard/mTPMS
    * English language

    How to use:

    * Power on the iTPMSystem
    * Pair your device to the iTPMSystem unit, test with the Vendor supplied app and close it. If it doesn't work then this app probably won't either.
    * Launch iTPMSystem, you should see message that you are connected. You now need to wait for the sensors to start sending data through the iTPMSystem.
    * Once discovered map them to their wheel locations in the preferences.
