Description: |-
    ScrollSocket sends mouse wheel events to the computer as you move your finger
    over the android touchscreen. Requires a small driver to be running on the
    computer.  See <a href="http://powerinside.github.io/ScrollSocket/">website</a> for more
    details on building the driver from source.

    * Currently supports only linux with uinput kernel module.
    * Horizontal scrolling not yet added.

    This is a fork of the much awesome https://f-droid.org/packages/at.bitfire.gfxtablet app.
