AutoName: House of Cards
Description: |-
    The game starts with a standard deck of 52 cards. There are also four
    Houses each “coloured” by one of the four suits. You put one by one
    the random cards, that the dealer randomly deals from the deck, to one
    of the different Houses (it is of no importance the cards to be of the
    same suit with the House), trying to achieve a total of 31 in the house.
    The total is calculated adding the cards (Ace counts for 11, Kings,
    Queens, Jacks for 10 and the rest as they are, i.e. the 8 of Spades
    counts for 8). Every time you manage to achieve a 31 in one of the
    houses you get a bonus regarding the House in which you achieved that
    (10 for Spades, 20 for Clubs, 30 for Diamonds, 40 for Hearts) and the
    House becomes empty (total = 0). If in one of the Houses the total will
    exceed 31 then this House is closed and you cannot use it any more adding
    cards to it. In order to win you should add all 52 cards in the Houses
    and only then your score counts in the hall of fame. You lose if all the
    four Houses will be closed.

    If the number of cards in a House will be six (6) and the total is less
    than 31, it counts as a 31, the player gets 50 points and the House
    becomes empty.

    This rule adds 4 Jokers to the deck (each with a different suit). If
    you add it to the House “coloured” with the same suit (e.g. the Heart
    special card to the Heart House) then it is like having 31 no matter
    what was the total there and the player gets 100 points, but if you
    add it to a House “coloured” with another suit (e.g. the Heart card
    to the Diamond House) you lose immediately.
