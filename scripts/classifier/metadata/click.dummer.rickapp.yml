AutoName: Rick App
Description: |-
    '''NOTE:''' This app is no longer maintained, its repo was archived.

    The Rick-App plays a automatic burp in silent situations. This App makes it
    possible to talk like Rick in ''Rick and Morty''.

    Features:

    * Threshold ruler: modify the noise limit
    * RickApp plays a burp sound, if there is a realy short time without noise
    * It plays a new burp only after 2 seconds to protect from endless burps
    * If your mobile plays sound, RickApp ''hears'' it, too.
    * RickApp shows the sound sampling values in a textbox

    Your Screen is off, but RickApp does not sleep! Use the ''recent App'' feature
    of your Homescreen and close RickApp by swiping it away.

    '''This App uses the microphone! You can not use the microphone, if you get a
    call and RickApp works!'''
