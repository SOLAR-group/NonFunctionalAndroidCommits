AutoName: PianOli
Description: |-
    Have a baby curious about shiny tablets and phones? Use this app as a
    baby-game and, more importantly, to prevent random taps of a baby from
    doing anything you may not want. This app will show a small piano a baby
    can use to explore sounds in a mobile device. At the same time, it will
    block any naive attempts at closing the app. The back, home and apps-menu
    buttons will be blocked, and Android's top menu won't be available. This
    ensures a baby can't accidentally close the game, preventing any actions on
    the device you may not want.
