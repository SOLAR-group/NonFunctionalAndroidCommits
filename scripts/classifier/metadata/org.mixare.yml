Description: |-
    Point the camera and see what’s around. Uses a variety of sources, including
    Wikipedia , Twitter, OpenStreetMap and mixare.org. Versions after 0.9.2 are
    built from a different repository which avoids the Google Maps requirement and
    uses OSM instead. (This is not fully implemented yet).

    Google Maps don’t function in the f-droid.org build, because API keys aren’t in
    the source code.

    Anti-feature: Dependencies. It’s necessary for Google Maps to be already
    installed either as an app or as a shared system library for this app to be
    installable.

    '''Note:''' This app is currently not actively maintained.
