AutoName: Interval Timer
Description: |-
    Privacy Friendly Interval Timer supports the user during his/her circuit
    training session and helps him achieve his/her training goals. In order to
    support the user during his training, the app provides stopwatches, which can be
    configured according to the user’s own training and resting phases. In addition,
    the app reminds the user of previously defined training sessions via a
    notification. To check the user’s goals and to recognize training progress, the
    app offers the possibility to retrieve statistics about the training times and
    the calories burned in a daily, weekly or monthly overview.

    This App requires minimal permissions and is part of the Privacy Friendly Apps
    group developed by the research group SECUSO at Technische Universität
    Darmstadt.
