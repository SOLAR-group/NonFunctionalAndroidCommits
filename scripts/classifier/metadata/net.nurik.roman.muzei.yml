AutoName: Muzei
Description: |-
    Muzei is a live wallpaper that gently refreshes your home screen each day with
    famous works of art. It also recedes into the background, blurring and dimming
    artwork to keep your icons and widgets in the spotlight. Simply double touch the
    wallpaper or open the Muzei app to enjoy and explore the artwork in its full
    glory.

    Alternatively, you can choose your favorite photos from your own gallery or
    other apps to use on your home screen. To keep your wallpaper fresh, Muzei will
    rotate through your favorite photos every few hours.

MaintainerNotes: |-
    Custom version format, so no UCM applies.

    Since 2.0, source code needs to be patched to get rid of Google Play Services.
    The "wearable" and "example-watchface" components should be removed
    completely, the rest of the code has to be cleaned up from FirebaseAnalytics.
