Description: |-
    This app records audio or video secretly and sends the results to OpenWatch: a
    participatory citizen media project to enable public monitoring of authority
    figures. See the tutorial section in the app for details on how to work it as it
    is deliberately made unobvious. All uploads are released under CC-BY (Creative
