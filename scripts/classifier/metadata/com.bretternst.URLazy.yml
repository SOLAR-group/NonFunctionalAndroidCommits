AutoName: URLazy
Description: |-
    Eases the pain of entering long URLs into a bunch of test devices by finding
    collections of URLs on the local network and allowing you to open them with a
    single tap. You can serve links from a GUI app on your workstation or from a
    Ruby script on a local development server (source code in same repo).

    URLazy finds this list with no configuration required, provided you are
    connected to your network via Wi-Fi. This makes it super easy to test your
    projects on real devices without manually setting up bookmarks or entering URLs.

    This is a better alternative to bookmarks or centralized index pages because new
    devices require no set-up and you don't have to edit URLs every time your
    environment changes - or if you take your work home. URLazy uses multicast UDP
    to find collections of links. If your network administrator enables it, this can
    even work across a corporate WAN.
