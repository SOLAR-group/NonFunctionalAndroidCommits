MaintainerNotes: |-
    Builds locally, but might break on BS. We need to integrate ndkbuild and gradle
    task into overall build, e.g. with preassemble=libs:anddown:packageNativeLibs
    instead of using `build=`. However, right now this breaks the app because the
    native libs don’t seem to get included.
