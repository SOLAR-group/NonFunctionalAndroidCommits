AutoName: Location Share
Description: |-
    Location Share is a simple Android application that allows you to share your
    current location.

    Location Share doesn’t require setting up an account, doesn’t track your
    location in the background, doesn’t auto-share it, and doesn’t send it to anyone
    except those you explicitly tell it to.

    It can share your location using any application that supports sharing plain
    text. This includes (but isn’t limited to) sharing via SMS, email, social
    networks, note taking applications, etc.

    Simply launch the application and wait until the device homes in on your
    location. You’ll then have the option to view the location on a map, share it,
    or copy it to the clipboard.
