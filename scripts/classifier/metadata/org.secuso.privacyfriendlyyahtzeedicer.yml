AutoName: Dice Game
Description: |-
    Privacy Friendly Dice Game is a very simple application to play a dice game with
    five dice. Particular dice can be saved for the next round by pressing them. A
    round counter helps to keep track over the round. The final result is displayed
    after round three. Users can define rules for collecting points like collecting
    pairs, three of kind, four of a kind, five of a kind, full house and others.

    The app belongs to the group of Privacy Friendly Apps developed at the
    <a href="https://secuso.org/">SECUSO research group</a> of Technische Universitaet
    Darmstadt. It does not require any permission and relinquishes advertisement and
    tracking mechanisms.
