Name: Nix-on-Droid
AutoName: Nix
Description: |-
    Nix-on-Droid brings Nix package manager of NixOS fame
    to your mobile device.
    If you're not after its advanced features,
    you might still be interested in tapping into nixpkgs,
    a vast collection of precompiled software.

    At first start the app will download Nix repackaged for Android,
    leaving you with a barebones system afterwards.
    If you are an experienced Nix user, you know what to do next.
    If you are in doubt, follow the on-screen instructions,
    to install more of the familiar Linux software
    and declaratively manage your environment.

    NOTE: this software is alpha-quality.
    Users that value
    stability and Android integration over
    features and package selection
    might better be served with Termux as of now.

    Nix-on-Droid uses a fork of Termux application as a terminal emulator.
