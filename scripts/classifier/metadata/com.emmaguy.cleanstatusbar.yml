AutoName: Clean Status Bar
Description: |-
    Tired of editing out notifications/low battery to make a nice, clean status bar?
    Run this app first - it draws over your status bar, showing only a full battery
    and clock.

    It runs as a service, so you can swap to other apps to take screenshots.
