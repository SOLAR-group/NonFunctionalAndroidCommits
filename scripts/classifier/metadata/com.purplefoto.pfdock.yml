AutoName: PurpleDock
Description: |-
    PurpleDock is a simple replacement for the car dock app that ships with many
    handsets. PurpleDock works in both Portrait and Landscape orientation. It works
    when connected to power and disconnected. GPS usage (used for speedometer) is
    throttled when not connected to power in order to save battery life.

    PurpleDock allows customization of three of the launch buttons. The stickpin,
    headphones, and microphone buttons are pre-assigned to Google Places, Google
    Music, and Voice Search. To override these buttons, tap and hold for 1 second to
    bring up an editor. You will need to know the full name of the application and
    the name of the Activity to launch, which can be got from
    https://f-droid.org/packages/com.ideasfrombrain.search_based_launcher_v2 or or the AndroidManifest.xml of
    the source code of the app.
