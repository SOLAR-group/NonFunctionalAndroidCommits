AutoName: YubiTOTP
Description: |-
    Generate One-Time Passwords (OTPs) using a YubiKey NEO hardware, connected using
    NFC. It generates codes that are compatible with Google two-step verification,
    and can be used with any other site that supports OATH TOTP.

    There are two apps for YubiKey NEO and OATH: YubiTOTP and YubiOATH. They work
    differently, and both are supported, but to get the most features and best user
    experience we recommend use of YubiOATH. The YubiTOTP app works with all YubiKey
    NEOs, however it is more limited than the YubiOATH app. The YubiOATH app
    requires that the (free software) ykneo-oath applet has been loaded on to the
    YubiKey NEO. The YubiTOTP app is still maintained for backwards compatibility.
