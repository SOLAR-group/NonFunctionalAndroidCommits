Description: |-
    This project enables ham radio operators to use their android phones as memory
    keyers to send CW or Hellschreiber signals using any radio transmitter capable
    of putting out a carrier wave. The application presents a list of editable
    phrases, then plays the selected phrase as morse code (or Hellschriber) through
    the sound output. The audible tones produced may be used directly if a modulated
    signal is desired, but the sound can also be routed through an easy-to-build
    interface which converts this sound into on/off keying for the transmitter.
