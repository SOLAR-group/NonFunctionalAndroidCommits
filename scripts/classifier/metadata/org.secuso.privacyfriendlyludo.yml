    ''How to play''

    ''Game''

    Each player has four figures which are marked in the player’s color. At the
    beginning the of the game the figures are in the house. To leave the house the
    player has to roll a six on a six-sided die.

    Once a figure has left the house, the figure can be moved based on the result of
    a die role. To prevent opponents from winning, their figures can be sent back to
    the house. This happens if a player moves his figure to a field with a figure.
    Each player has four goal fields. The first player has reaches the goal with all
    his figures wins.
