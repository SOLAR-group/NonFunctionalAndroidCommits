Name: Rotation Lock + Landscape
AutoName: Rotation Lock+Landscape
Description: |-
    Turn on/off Auto-rotate screen quickly by long pressing search button.

    When you are lying on bed. The screen changes to landscape. Have to open system
    settings to disable Auto-rotate screen. Did you find it is really inconvenient?
    This app provides a super easy way for switching this setting. And it provides a
    state icon to indicate the current setting.

    Fork of https://f-droid.org/packages/org.penghuang.tools.rotationlock.
