AutoName: aLogcat ROOT
Description: |-
    An app equivalent of logcat from the terminal. You can filter by importance in
    the settings: see only errors or view general debugging info. The result can
    then be filtered by keyword so if an app has problems you can send just the
    relevant logs to the developer. But watch out, the filter remains in place
    unless you remove it!

    This application is fork of https://f-droid.org/packages/org.jtb.alogcat and it works only on devices
    running Android 4.1+. If you have root access full system logs are shown,
    otherwise only this applications logs are shown.
