Description: |-
    Shows a notification icon in the status bar when headphones are plugged into the
    phone.

    After installation, you have to start the application at least once. Then it
    will be running as a background service that shows the headset status icon
    whenever the headphones are plugged in. You can close the app, and the status
    icon will still work - even after rebooting your phone.
