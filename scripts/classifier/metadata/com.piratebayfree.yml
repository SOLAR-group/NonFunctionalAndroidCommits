AutoName: TPB Proxy
Description: |-
    Proxy(s) for the ever-moving Pirate Bay torrent indexing website; ideal for
    people struggling with Internet censorship such as those residing in the UK,
    Ireland, Netherlands, Belgium or Finland.

    TPB Proxy automatically unblocks The Pirate Bay and provides fast and stable
    access to Linux ISO torrents.

    More recent versions, for which there isn't source code, allow you to do more,
    but this version only allows you to choose proxies and open the website in a
    browser.

    This is the 'free' (as in gratis) version.

    Several proprietary libraries were removed.
