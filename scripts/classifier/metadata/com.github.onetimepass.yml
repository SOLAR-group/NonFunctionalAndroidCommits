AutoName: OneTimePass
Description: |-
    OneTimePass is a clean and robust two-factor TOTP application and supports the
    following features:

    * Supports opening otpauth:// URLs
    * Scan QR codes to create new accounts easily
    * View QR codes to export existing accounts
    * Searchable, sortable listing of accounts
    * Manual entry account creation
    * Import/Export for backup and restore purposes
    * Relies upon AES-256 for on-device encryption
    * Supports Android 5.0 (and up)

    OneTimePass is the reincarnation of the now-retired OneTimePad app. If you used
    OneTimePad, you should really migrate to this [or any other TOTP based]
    application.
