AutoName: DSC Auto Rename
Description: |-
    Automatically change the name of images files taken by the camera based on the
    date and time when the file was created.

    '''Renamed and moved files process cannot be rolled back! Use this software with
    caution!'''

    The application does not store the old names because will cause conflicts: the
    default camera application use a counter which is reset each time when files are
    removed/renamed. As a workaround can be selected the option "Append original
    name".
