AutoName: Flashlight
Description: |-
    Uses the LED on your device’s camera as a flashlight. If your device does not
    have a camera LED, it will paint a white box on your screen to enable it to
    serve as a poor substitute for a flashlight.

    Requires the Camera permission to control your device’s LED but you will notice
    that it does not require the Internet permission as it serves no ads.
