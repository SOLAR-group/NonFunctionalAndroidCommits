Description: |-
    Where are the Eyes is a tool for detecting and evading surveillance. Together,
    you and other users build a map of surveillance cameras to protect activists,
    students, and other at-risk minorities.

    When run, the map will display red pins on cameras near your location. To mark a
    new camera, or verify that a marked camera exists, just stand near it and press
    the "eye" button.

    The app has telemetry on by default. Press "Mapbox" button on the main screen to
    disable it.
