AutoName: CatLog
Description: |-
    CatLog shows a scrolling (tailed) view of the Android "Logcat" system log, hence
    the goofy name. It also allows you to record logs in real time, send logs via
    email, and filter using a variety of criteria. It has a widget, can record logs
    in the background and has useful colour coding.

    It won't work on Android 4.1+ without root access, since apps are not allowed to
    access each others' logs.
