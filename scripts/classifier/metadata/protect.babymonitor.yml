AutoName: Protect Baby Monitor
Description: |-
    Protect Baby Monitor allows two Android devices to act as a baby monitor. The
    first device, left in the room with the baby, will advertise itself on the
    network and stream audio to a connected client. The second device, with the
    parent, will connect to the monitoring device and receive an audio stream.
