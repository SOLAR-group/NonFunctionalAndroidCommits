Description: |-
    As a minimalistic workout tracker SWJ is designed for those who know what they
    want and who are concentrated on results. You will not find predefined
    description for routines or any other amateur targeted features here. It is
    similar to simple sheet of paper where you write down exercises with repetitions
    and sets you have performed.

    It consists of two synced lists: one for exercises you have performed, and the
    second for sets you have done. Also has the ability to write down a note for an
    exercise or set -- and here we are: Maximal informativity with minimum of
    interactions.

    Additionally you can create report for chosen exercise with graph and some
    stats.
