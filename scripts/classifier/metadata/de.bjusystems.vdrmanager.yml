Description: |-
    If you have a VDR at home reachable over the internet and own a mobile phone
    running Android then you possibly find this program useful. Using it you can
    view the EPG and stream live TV to your device.

    VDR-Manager has two parts:

    * The Android application for the user interface
    * A VDR plugin to communicate with. Standard SVDRP is not used because this leads to much more traffic.

    * list the EPG filtered by time or channel
    * show EPG details
    * search EPG for some simple text
    * list, modify, delete or (de)activate timers
    * create timers from EPG events
    * remote wakeup VDR host using HTTP requests
