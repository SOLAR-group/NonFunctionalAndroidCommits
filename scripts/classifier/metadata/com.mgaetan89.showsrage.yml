AutoName: ShowsRage
Description: |-
    ShowsRage is an application that allows you to manage your
    <a href="https://www.sickrage.tv/">SickRage</a> installation.

    Support for <a href="http://www.sickbeard.com/">SickBeard</a> (or any other variant) is not
    guaranteed, but the main features should work properly.

    ShowsRage intend to provide the same features as on the web interface, packed
    inside a modern and easy-to-use Android application.

    The following features are currently available:

    * Support Android 4.0.3 and up
    * Based on <a href="https://www.google.com/design/">Material Design</a>
    * Shows information: list, get info, list seasons and episodes
    * Shows management: add, pause/resume, change quality, delete
    * Episode management: search, set status, stream, list coming
    * Logs
    * Shows statistics
    * Update SickRage (requires SickRage 4.0.30)

    The dependency on Google Play Services has been removed in this binary, but this
    prevents Casting from working.
