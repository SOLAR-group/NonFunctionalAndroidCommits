    * SCUMM (Classic 2D <a href="http://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/LucasArts">LucasArts</a> games: Full Throttle, Day of the Tentacle, etc.)
    * AGI (Early <a href="http://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/Sierra">Sierra</a> adventure games: King’s Quest, Leisure Suit Larry etc.)
    * SCI (Newer Sierra adventure games: Space Quest, Police Quest etc.)

    <a href="https://raw.github.com/scummvm/scummvm/HEAD/dists/android/README.Android">README
    of Android port</a>

    Unlike upstream build, this one has all plugins bundled together in single apk.
    External plugin apks (e.g. from Google Play) won’t work with this version and
    must be removed before installing it.

MaintainerNotes: |-
    Releases are tagged, but according to backends/platform/android/android.mk (which also contains
    version codes -- however, it hasn't been raised in a while), Market uploads take priority. They
    may lag notably behind general development, so checking https://sourceforge.net/projects/scummvm/files/scummvm/
    is advisable as well.
