Description: |-
    '''Warning:''' This app cannot be uninstalled, changes cannot be reverted. Make
    a full backup first.

    SecDroid hardens the android kernel by disable certain binaries that have
    internet access or can be used as an attack vector and by securing the TCP Stack
    using Systctl. This helps prevent some MITM (Man-In-The-Middle) and Spoofing
    attacks. It may also prevent some DOS (Denial-Of-Service) Attacks.

    Disabled services include SSH, SSHD, Telnet NC (net cat), and Ping, to keep
    others from gaining access to your device via a remote terminal. SecDroid also
    disables Package Manager so that no apps can be installed remotely to your
    device (you can still install them from Market or using APK files directly on
    the device itself). Lastly, it also allows you to disable ADBD (the ADB service
    running on the device that allows you to connect to it through command line from
    a remote computer) until the next reboot.
