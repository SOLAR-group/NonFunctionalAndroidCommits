AutoName: Microphone
Description: |-
    This microphone just feeds audio from the phoneâ€™s mic right out of its speaker,
    which means you get a horrible screeching feedback noise.

    However, plug the thing into your computer with a male to male headphone jack
    and your phone becomes a PC mic.
