Description: |-
    A traditional strategy game to be played on a tablet. Play with up to 6 players,
    or against the machine.

    The objective is to be first to race one’s pieces across the gameboard. Each
    player has ten pieces. Players take turns moving a single piece, either by
    moving one step to an adjacent unoccupied space or by jumping in one of any
    number of available consecutive hops over other single pieces. There is no
    capturing, so hopped pieces remain active on the gameboard. In other languages :
    jeu de Dames chinoises (Fr), Halma (De), Kinaschack spel (Se), Damas chinas
    (Es), Dama chinese (It), 中國跳棋, 中国のチェッカー, Китайские шашки.
