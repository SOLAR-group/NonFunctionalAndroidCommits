AutoName: Free Speech
Description: |-
    Free Speech is a sound board for people who have problems speaking. When you
    press a button, a sound is played. You can use recorded sounds, record new
    sounds, or generate sounds using the text-to-speech (TTS) built-into Android.
    Free Speech is an augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) program that
    provides a low-cost alternative to dedicated speech generating devices (SGD).
