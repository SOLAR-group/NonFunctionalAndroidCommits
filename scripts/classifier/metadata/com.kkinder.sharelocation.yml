Summary: Share your location
Description: |-
    Share your location via any of the messaging apps you have installed.

    N.B It isn’t possible to view your position on a map because Google Maps is the
    only map source and f-droid can’t supply an API key to use it. If you need to
    use Google Maps install the developer’s build from the website.
