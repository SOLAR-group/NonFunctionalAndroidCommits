AutoName: Short URL Evaluator
Description: |-
    ''Short URL Evaluator'' lengthens shortened URLs for correct handling in
    Android.

    This app is designed to be a short-URL unshortener. Android sometimes
    launches an app if it recognizes the URL, for example, a link to
    maps.google.com will open in the Maps app. However, this does not work for
    short URLs, they will open in a browser, and many browsers will then just
    open the mobile web site corresponding to the link.

    This app will take the short url, unshorten it, and give it back so that
    android can launch the correct application.

    Over 350 URL-shortening services are supported!
