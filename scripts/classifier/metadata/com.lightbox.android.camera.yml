    Camera implementation based off the Android Gingerbread camera app source code.

    Initially the Android Gingerbread camera source was forked, and then modified to
    become backwards compatible down to API level 7 (Eclair). The video
    functionality has also been removed and other changes made to fix problems with
    indivdual devices.
