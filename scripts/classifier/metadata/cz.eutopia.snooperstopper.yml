AutoName: SnooperStopper
Description: |-
    Allows you to create a different encryption password for booting your device
    than unlocking your screen. This allows you to have a stronger device encryption
    password (which you only need to enter once after booting your device) and a
    simpler pattern/PIN/password for unlocking your screen.

    If an attacker tries to guess your simple pattern/PIN/password, he has only few
    tries (default is 3) after which the device is rebooted and he needs to enter
    your strong device encryption password again.

    Root privileges required.
