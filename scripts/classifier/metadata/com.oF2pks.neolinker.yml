Description: |-
    Hybrid version of Flashify & Browser-Intercept (without any permission or
    security weakness)

    '''Flashify Open websites in another browser via Share option'''

    ...is a simple utility app that takes a url from the Share Intent in
    Android and opens it in another browser. It was orginally designed to
    easily open Adobe Flash websites in a browser that supports Flash but is
    equally useful for quickly testing mobile websites in multiple browsers.
