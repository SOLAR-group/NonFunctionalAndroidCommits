AutoName: Card Game Scores
Description: |-
    The purpose is to keep scores for games where each turn could give you any
    (random) score, and not a fixed block; for that type of game, use
    https://f-droid.org/packages/com.nolanlawson.keepscore.

    You have two options: "New Game" or "Last Game". On either of them, you can
    add/delete people, change the maximum score and choose between win or lose at
    that score.

    For example, on Uno, you can set the maximum score at 200 and set it to lose, so
    that when someone crosses the 200 barrier, the game ends and a "LOOSER" banner
    appear alongside the name who lost.

    During the game, a number box will be available for you to input the points
    accumulated, with ENTER changing down for the next, and an empty box being the
    same as zero points. After updating all scores, click on the update button.

    The app will save the data (names, score, win/lose) of your last game, so you
    can re-use it later via the "Last Game" button.
