AutoName: Dasher
Description: |-
    Dasher is an information-efficient, text-entry interface, driven by a natural
    continuous steering of the cursor into boxes representing the letter you want to
    input.

    Dasher is especially useful for text-entry wherever a full-size keyboard cannot
    be used â€” for example,

    * when operating a computer one-handed, by joystick, touchscreen, trackball, or mouse;
    * when operating a computer with zero hands (i.e., by head-mouse or by eyetracker);
    * on a palmtop computer;
    * on a wearable computer.
