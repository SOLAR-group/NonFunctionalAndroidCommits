AutoName: Light controller
Description: |-
    Control LED bulbs from following manufacturers:

    * AppLamp
    * EasyBulb
    * Limitless LED
    * MiLight
    * ilux

    The widget gives you easy access to switch each zone on and off as well as
    global control. Also included is easy access to the main application for more
    advanced control.

    There are a number of configurable modes. Light listening mode will attempt to
    detect the beat of the music playing and pulse different colors to the music,
    candle mode to emulate the flickering of a candle, along with the built in disco
    modes.

    You will need the Wifi Controller box to access these lights from the
    application. If the application doesnâ€™t work out of the box, you may need to
    setup the IP address of your controller box, by default the application will
    attempt to broadcast to the whole network, this does not work in all setups.
