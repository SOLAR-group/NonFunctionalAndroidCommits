AutoName: OI Flashlight
Description: |-
    OI Flashlight is a simple and effective application that helps you find a way in
    the dark. OI Flashlight locks the display backlight on, clearly illuminating the
    surrounding area.

    For devices with a camera flash, OI Flashlight can also use the flash as a
    bright torch to brighten the room. The color of the backlight is completely
    customizable with OI Color Picker.
