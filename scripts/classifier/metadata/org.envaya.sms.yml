AutoName: EnvayaSMS
Description: |-
    EnvayaSMS can be used to enable any web service to send and receive SMS and MMS
    messages nearly anywhere in the world. In particular, it is useful in countries
    where obtaining a local virtual phone number or SMS shortcode is difficult,
    expensive, or impossible. A phone running EnvayaSMS connects to the phone
    network in the same way as any other mobile phone, so it can be set up without
    needing approval from anyone else.

    EnvayaSMS is designed to to be maintainable even when deployed in remote
    locations that cannot easily be accessed by your organization’s technical staff.
    With minimal training, non-technical users can do all setup and maintenance of
    deployed phones. The number of SMS’ that can be sent is capped by Android at
    100/hour. Expansion pack apks, not yet available from f-droid.org can lift this
    limit.
