AutoName: BitShares Wallet
Description: |-
    '''NOTE:''' This app is no longer maintained (its repo was archived).

    Cryptocurrency volatility is now a thing of the past. BitShares’ Smartcoins are
    tokens that are market-pegged to individual fiat currencies like the Dollar,
    Euro, Yuan and assets like Businesses, Gold and Oil. Thousands of investors,
    savers, traders and employers now use Smartcoins to buy and sell goods and
    services globally.

    No bank account? No problem. The unbanked and underbanked can now buy, sell and
    use Smartcoins locally with anyone, or utilize one of the many Exchanges who
    will convert your fiat into Smartcoins and back again if needed. CCEDK.com,
    Poloniex, Bittrex, BTC38 and Yunbi just to name a few.

    BitShares itself is not a company, it’s a Decentralized Autonomous Community
    (DAC) of friendly FinTech people of all ages wanting freemarket solutions to
    secure life, liberty and property for all. BitShares software uses the Delegated
    Proof Of Stake (DPOS) consensus protocol which cannot be blocked, taken down or
    centralized by asic or quantum computing hardware.
