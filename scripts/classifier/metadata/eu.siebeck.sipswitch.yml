AutoName: SIP Switch
Description: |-
    Android 2.3 (Gingerbread) and newer has a built in SIP/VoIP client. The widget
    has two buttons: The left one gives you a shortcut to the SIP settings i.e. to
    enable incoming calls. The second one allows you to select how calls should be
    routed primarily: you can select whether all calls should be made via SIP by
    default; only Internet calls via SIP (Airplane mode), or if you want to be asked
    before each call.
