    '''NOTE:''' This app is no longer maintained (its repo was archived).

    https://f-droid.org/packages/net.nurik.roman.dashclock extension that displays the number of unread
    emails from https://f-droid.org/packages/com.fsck.k9, from your choice of accounts.

    Marking messages as read in K-9 won’t reliably update the unread count if you
    are using v4.201 of K-9 — current versions of K-9 should work fine.
