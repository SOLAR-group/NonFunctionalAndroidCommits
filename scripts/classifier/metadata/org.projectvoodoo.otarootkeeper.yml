AutoName: Voodoo OTA RootKeeper
Description: |-
    '''Does not work for Android 4.3 updates'''

    This application makes a backup or a protected backup of your device’s root.
    This device must already be rooted: OTA RootKeeper doesn’t have the ability to
    root devices. If several conditions are matched, OTA RootKeeper will make root
    survive OTAs, and anything else except /system partition formatting.

    Requirement:

    * /system partition as Ext2, Ext3 or Ext4
    * Upgrades not formatting or overwriting completely the /system partition.
    * See website for info about devices that meet these requirements

    Require root: Yes.
