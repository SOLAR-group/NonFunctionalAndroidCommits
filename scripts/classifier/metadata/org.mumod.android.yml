Description: |-
    Client for <a href="http://status.net/wiki/Take_a_tour">StatusNet</a> (now known as
    <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/social">GNU social</a>). GNU social is a microblogging
    platform somewhat like Twitter, but decentralized. Some examples are:
    <a href="https://status.fsf.org">fsf.org</a>, and <a href="http://bka.li">bka.li</a>. (The latter is in
    German, as is the website)

    Twitter is disabled in this build, but in future versions it will be possible to
    enter oAuth credentials into the app, after registering your own client at
    dev.twitter.com. It is already possible to add oAuth credentials for StatusNet
    sites.
