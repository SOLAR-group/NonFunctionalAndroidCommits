AutoName: JLyr Lyrics
Description: |-
    You can search for lyrics from a list of lyrics websites without leaving the app
    or go to popular search engines. If you have a Scrobbler like
    https://f-droid.org/packages/net.jjc1138.android.scrobbler or https://f-droid.org/packages/com.adam.aslfms installed then JLyr can
    detect what you are listening to and search for the lyrics automatically. The
    app is also able to detect what the stock Music app (https://f-droid.org/packages/com.android.music) is
    playing, without a Scrobbler.
