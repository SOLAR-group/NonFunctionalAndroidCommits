AutoName: Beauty Clock
Description: |-
    Bijin Tokei is a genre of wallpaper that is popular in East Asia. Every minute
    the wallpaper changes to a picture of a pretty girl holding an object that
    displays the time.

    This app will download the pictures for every minute from your chosen site
    without caching them ''but'' it will check if images already exist in
    '''sdcard/BeautyClock/pic/site/''' and the scheme is always aabb.jpg where aa is
    the hour and bb is the minute. In this way, you can have the app display any
    images that you want.
