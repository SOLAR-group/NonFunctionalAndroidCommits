    Omnidroid is an automated event/action manager that allows users to automate
    system functionality based on incoming application intents. It also provides a
    general plug-in framework that allows any compatible application events to
    trigger any other applications actions. An intuitive user interface allows the
    user to control what events cause what actions to occur.
