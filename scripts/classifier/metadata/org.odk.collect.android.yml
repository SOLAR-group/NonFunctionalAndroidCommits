AutoName: ODK Collect
Description: |-
    Sample blank surveys can be downloaded within the app.

    Open Data Kit (ODK) is a cross-platform set of tools which help organizations
    author, field, and manage mobile data collection solutions. ODK provides an
    out-of-the-box solution for users to:

    * Build a data collection form or survey;
    * Collect the data on a mobile device and send it to a server; and
    * Aggregate the collected data on a server and extract it in useful formats.

    In addition to socio-economic and health surveys with GPS locations and images,
    ODK is being used to create decision support for clinicians and for building
    multimedia-rich nature mapping tools. See featured deployments and list of tools
    for more examples of what the ODK community is doing. We welcome and encourage
    participation from the user community.

    Newer versions of this app exist, but contain proprietary software, so updates
    are unlikely to appear here.
