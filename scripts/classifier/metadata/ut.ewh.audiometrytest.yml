Description: |-
    '''Note:''' this app is no longer actively maintained.

    AME is designed to diagnose hearing loss without the need for expensive medical
    machines. Using signal analysis and your phone or tablet’s own microphone, AME
    can calibrate virtually any pair of earphones for a hearing test that will
    return the user’s hearing thresholds in dB HL. It also provides services for the
    user to save test results, view them later, and email test results anywhere from
    within the app.
