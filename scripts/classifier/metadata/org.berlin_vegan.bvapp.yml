Description: |-
    With the "Berlin Vegan Guide", you’ve got quick access to an overview of the
    vegan food and shopping possibilities in Berlin, Germany --- even while you’re
    out and about.

    The app contains the following information:

    * over 300 restaurants, snack bars and takeaways with vegan declared offers
    * a further 200 shopping possibilities in the area of cosmetics, groceries and organic produce

    The guide is not just suitable for vegetarians and vegans but also for all
    people who are trying to live their life in a greener and more animal friendly
    way.

    '''NOTE:''' ''Berlin Vegan Guide'' was completely rewritten using Qt, and
    is now available for SailfishOS, iOS and Android. Due to technical reasons,
    it currently cannot be updated in the f-droid.org repo (and there’s no ETA
    yet for this). To switch between versions from f-droid.org and IzzyOnDroid,
    you’ll have to first uninstall and then reinstall the app (as you’d have to
    do when switching between F-Droid and Google Play).

MaintainerNotes: |-
    * Versions <= 2.0 do not build from the current repo, but one needs to use the old repo <https://github.com/smeir/Berlin-Vegan-Guide>
    * Auto Update Mode is working, but only with a hack: with commit dd0b38a in fdroidserver the tag is used as versionname, if the versionname could not be parse from the manifest or gradle files.
    * Archive Policy: 'Currently the only supported format is "n versions", where n is the number of versions to keep.'
    * Auto Update Mode: '... if an app always has a tag "2.7.2" corresponding to version 2.7.2, you would simply specify "Version %v"'
    * Update Check Mode: '... when apps tag non-release versions such as X.X-alpha, so you can filter them out with something like .*[0-9]$ which requires tag names to end with a digit.'

ArchivePolicy: 1 versions
AutoUpdateMode: Version %v
UpdateCheckMode: Tags .*[0-9]$
CurrentVersion: 2.0.8
CurrentVersionCode: 26
