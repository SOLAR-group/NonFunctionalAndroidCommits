AutoName: BeamControl for Smart Interface
Description: |-
    This application makes use of the Smart Factory (Industry 4.0) interface of
    BeamConstruct laser marking software, RepliSLS3D SLS/SLM/3D printing
    software and of any other software solution which provides a compatible
    interface. It can be used to watch the production/building state of one
    application or of several machine within a complete production line.

    The application can be configured to connect to an nearly unlimited number
    of software instances. Then it watches their current production state and
    notifies the user as soon as something changes or when an event occurs,
    that requires manual interaction. Thus one operator can control a complete
    production line easily.

    This application also acts as demonstration for the Smart Factory (Industry
    4.0) interface which also can be used to integrate these applications in an
    automated production line. The sources of this application are available
    for free and can be used to implement own Smart Factory solutions.
