Summary: Secure messaging
Description: |-
    This Instant Messenger has a built-in end-to-end point encryption, which means
    every outgoing message is only readable by your contact.

    On the installation the application creates a key pair on your phone device. One
    Public-Key and a Private-Key, with the Public-Key you can encrypt messages but
    you cannot decrypt it. Decryption is only possible with your Private-Key.

    The messages go via a server and you enter a phone number into the app so that
    your friends know how to find you.
