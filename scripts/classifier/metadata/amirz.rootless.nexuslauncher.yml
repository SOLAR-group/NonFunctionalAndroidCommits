Description: |-
    ''Pixel Launcher'' is a close to AOSP launcher that only changes the
    necessary code to allow for small extensions and backporting to older

    * Search bar at the bottom
    * Wallpaper based theme selection
    * Regular Icon Packs
    * Adaptive Icon Packs, such as my Google Icons
    * Icon Shape selection on Android 8.0
