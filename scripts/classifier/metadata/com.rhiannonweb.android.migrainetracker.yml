AutoName: Migraine Tracker
Description: |-
    Migraine Tracker is a simple event tracking app. Originally designed as a
    personal application to track migraines, it can be used to track any recurring
    eventâ€™s time and duration for later analysis.

    The UI is designed to be as simple as possible, allowing ease of use during
    severe headaches or other events where a complex or feature-heavy UI is
    unwelcome.

    Migraine Tracker does not, and is not intended to, diagnose or treat any
    condition. It merely collects data for later analysis by a qualified
    professional instead of using paper forms or notebooks. All data is stored
    locally on your Android device, and only event duration and score is stored.
