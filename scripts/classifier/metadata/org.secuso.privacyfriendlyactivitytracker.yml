AutoName: Pedometer
Description: |-
    Count your steps in background to provide you an overview about your walked
    steps, distance and about the calories you have burned while walking. The app
    allows you to define custom walking modes and notifications if the achievement
    of your daily step goal is in danger.  You can add and choose different walking
    modes, such as walking or running, to improve the calculation of distance and
    calories. In a special training mode you can track your training sessions. To
    each training session additional information, such as feeling or a description,
    can be added.

    The app requires minimal permissions (Run at startup and prevent phone from
    sleeping). It belongs to the group of Privacy Friendly Apps developed at the
    <a href="https://secuso.org/">SECUSO research group</a> of Technische Universitaet
    Darmstadt.
