AutoName: My Contacts
Description: |-
    Recent Contacts lets you see your recently and most called contacts in one
    overview, and it lets you make direct phone calls straight from the widget
    itself without launching the dialer app first. As with any widget, if you donâ€™t
    like using it, it can easily be removed.
