Description: |-
    Privacy Friendly Checkers is a strategy board game for two players. The
    objective of the game is to either capture all opposing game pieces by jumping
    over them or by creating a situation in which the opponent cannot make a move
    anymore due to being blocked.

    The app belongs to the group of Privacy Friendly Apps developed by the SECUSO
    research group at Technische Universit√§t Darmstadt.
