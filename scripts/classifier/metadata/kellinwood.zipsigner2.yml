Description: |-
    ZipSigner is an Android app for signing Zip, Apk, and/or Jar files on-board
    Android devices. Similar to jarsigner and signapk, this app can be used to sign
    update zip files, APK, or JAR files using one of the four built-in keys, or with
    your own private keys. The keystore and key creation features provide some of
    the same functionality as the Java keytool utility.

    The built-in keys and auto-select modes allow rooted themers and modders to sign
    updates and modified APKs. Signing with private keys is an activity performed by
    developers in order to publish apps.
