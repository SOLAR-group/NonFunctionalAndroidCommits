Description: |-
    Choose your favorite virtual Googly pet and simply move your face in front of
    your smartphone to wake it up. Once your virtual pet is awake, its Googly Eyes
    will track you for hours without blinking! Even if your new virtual pet doesnâ€™t
    show any signs of tiredness, it will automatically fall asleep as soon as you
    disappear from your screen.

    AntiFeature: Billing library required.
