AutoName: Form-N-Fun
Description: |-
    Form ‘N’ Fun is an android maze game based on real time computer vision.
    The user draws a custom maze on a white piece of paper and the device
    camera creates graphics according to the geometric shape and ball allowing
    the user to play using the accelerometer. The app uses contours algorithms
    in OpenCV to detect maze that is drawn on the paper and JBox2d engine for
    simulating the rigid bodies.

    In order to use Form-N-Fun, you also need to install the OpenCV Manager application.
