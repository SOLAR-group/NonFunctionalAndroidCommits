AutoName: Corporate Addressbook
Description: |-
    The Global Address List (GAL) lookup available in Android is limited in
    functionality. It only looks up the email address and does not provide other
    information that is available in the GAL. This application looks up the GAL and
    returns ALL data that is available on the Exchange server for the query.
