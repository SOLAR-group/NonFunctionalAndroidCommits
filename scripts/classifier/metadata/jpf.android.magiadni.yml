Description: |-
    Magia DNI uses the device's camera to read the OCR data on Spanish identity
    cards, calculates its check digit and displays it. It is mostly of interest to
    Spanish people; its purpose is to debunk an urban legend that says that the
    check digit present on the OCR data represents the number of people who are
    named exactly as the card's holder.
