Description: |-
    This app allows you to add specific IP routes on Android to route the IP
    traffic. It is possible to set address, netmask, gateway and metric. Due to the
    nature of the "ip route" command, root access is necessary. It is possible to
    apply routes based on the active SSID, to ensure the route is only applied in
    the correct Wifi network. If it is set, the routes are applied during the
    Android boot.
