Description: |-
    Allows students to simply and easily track their grades. Create classes and add
    grades for each of those classes. Each grade is created with a name and the
    point value it holds. With this you can calculate the percentage and overall
    grade for each class. Gradr also allows students to automatically predict how
    many points they need on their next assignment to get the grade that they
    desire.
