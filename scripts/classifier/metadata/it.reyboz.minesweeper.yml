AutoName: MineSweeper
Description: |-
    Classic single-player one-tap puzzle game where you have a virtual minefield and
    you must liberate it. If you play tapping randomly in the field probably your
    penguin will become a good petard, otherwise you and your cute penguin are
    probably destined to survive. MineSweeper is considered a
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minesweeper_%28video_game%29#Computational_complexity">co-NP-complete</a> computational complexity puzzle.

    Tips:

    * There are exactly "n" bombs around any number!
    * Hold-tap to place flags.
    * Did you find the easter egg in the language selection already?

    Permissions:

    Every permission of this app (with exception of Vibration and Audio permissions)
    are not really used for any purpose (are automatically inserted by Cordova
    during the build process).

    Notes from the Author:

    This app is intentionally created exclusively in HTML5, Javascript and CSS with
    Cordova/PhoneGap. So this app is potentially multiplatform and if you know how
    to bring this application on other platforms you are free to do so, and please
    do so! See the <a href="http://minesweeper.reyboz.it/minesweeper/README.txt">README</a>
    before studying or improving this app.
