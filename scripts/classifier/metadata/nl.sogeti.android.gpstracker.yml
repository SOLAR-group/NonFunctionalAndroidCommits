AutoName: Open GPS Tracker
Description: |-
    An app to record the path you've taken. OpenStreetMap can be used as a map
    provider by changing one of the settings and tracks can by uploaded to OSM from
    within the app.

    Anti-feature: Dependencies. It's necessary for Google Maps to be already
    installed either as an app or as a shared system library for this app to be
    installable. We will be able to remove this dependency as soon as we figure out
    how to build the app from source.
