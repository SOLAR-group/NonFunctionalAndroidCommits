Description: |-
    Play <a href="http://www.spiel-tac.de/">TAC</a> on the go.

    ''MoTAC'' is a mobile board for the TAC board game. This app and your TAC cards
    is all you need to play TAC everywhere. Save and resume your game at any time.
    ''MoTAC'' is the best way for playing TAC while traveling.

    You can play with 1-4 players, because MoTAC allows any move possible on a real
    board. Counters are moved per drag-and-drop to any location on the board.
    However, basic rule checking is also included. Tap a counter for displaying all
    allowed moves, choose one to automatically make the move. MoTAC can only be
    played along with the TAC cards. It solely replaces board and marbles.
