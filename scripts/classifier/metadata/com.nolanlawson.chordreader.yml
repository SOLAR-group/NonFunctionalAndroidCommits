Description: |-
    ChordReader is an app that fetches chord charts and tabulatures for your
    favorite songs from the Internet, saves them, and displays them in an
    easy-to-read format with the chords highlighted. The identified chords can also
    be transposed up or down, or you can add a capo. It's good for changing the key
    of a song to fit your vocal range.

    Doesn't work on tablets running android 4+ , but works for phones
