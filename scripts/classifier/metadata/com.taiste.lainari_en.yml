AutoName: Pocket Library
Description: |-
    Pocket Library is a new kind of a service for library patrons.

    The service expands the traditional notion of checking out materials, making it
    possible for library users to check out books and other items directly from
    other users anywhere.

    To be more generally useful as a library user’s personal information assistant,
    it also has the ability to manage the user’s loans and explore the library
    catalog.

    The service is currently tailored for Helsinki area public libraries’ catalog,
    but can be easily adapted for anybody using MARC21 catalogs.

    A proprietary analytics library was removed.
