AutoName: App Tracker
Description: |-
    App Tracker is a productivity app that keeps track of other apps youâ€™ve used,
    and compiles some useful statistics about them (most used, seldom used, recently
    used, etc.). You can then display this information in a widget or in the app
    itself, and launch them easily.

    Uses logcat to figure out what apps have been launched, which means it may not
    work on Android 4.1+.
