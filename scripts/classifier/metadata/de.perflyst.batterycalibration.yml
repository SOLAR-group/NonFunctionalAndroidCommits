AutoName: BatteryCalibration
Description: |-
    This is a simple open source battery calibration app which needs super user
    rights.

    '''How does it calibrate your battery?''' The app resets your fuel gauge and the
    batterystats.bin file.

    '''Why is superuser required?''' To reset the fuel gauge it has to write into a
    /sys/class/ file. This is not possible without superuser permission.
