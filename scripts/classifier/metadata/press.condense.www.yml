Description: |-
    News apps like Google News, Flipboard, BBC show trending articles written
    a day or two back. If say there are hundred articles written in a day, these news
    apps pick just a few of them. It is a time saving feature. But they lack a key
    flexibility.
    Consider you havenâ€™t read any news for the last 1 monthor 1 year.
    If you open any of the news apps or news websites, you will still be shown trending
    articles written a day or two back and not last month or last year. Hence this
    app https://f-droid.org/packages/press.condense.www picks popular articles of a website in a time range
    we specify.
    For example, techcrunch.com has 292,172 articles. But this app sorts
    all those articles based on popularity. This app is a a webview of [www.condense.press]
    and has PWA(Progressive Web App) features.
