Description: |-
    Edit files on your linux machine, even when you're on the go.

    Cooper provides a touch interface for SSH, making it easy to log in to a servers
    and edit files. Make simple code/configuration changes without squinting at a
    tiny terminal and using a special keyboard.

    Cooper does:

    * Allow password based login to SSH servers
    * Let you traverse the directory structure on SSH servers
    * Let you open and edit files on SSH servers
    * Save a list of your SSH servers (for easy access)

    This app is being developed to make remote software/web-app development easier,
    so future improvements will include tablet optimized layouts, a touch optimized
    command execution interface (menu based with support for custom commands), and a
    mechanism for jumping between open files.

    Cooper does not:

    * Allow command execution
    * Provide root/sudo support
    * Save your SSH password
    * Support non-standard SSH ports

    Status: Beta.
