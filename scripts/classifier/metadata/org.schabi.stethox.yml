AutoName: Stethox
Description: |-
    This is a Xposed Module that enables Stetho for every application on your
    phone. All Stetho functions are given besides Network Monitoring. For this
    however I highly recommend using mitmproxy or tcpdump and Wireshark.

    This Module can be used for Reverse Engineering. Especially the Layout Preview
    is very useful. Please also take a look at Inspackage since this will add even
    more functions for this purpose.

    ATTENTION:Never leave this Module enabled or installed on day to day use. THIS
    IS A SECURITY RISK. Only enable this for Development.
