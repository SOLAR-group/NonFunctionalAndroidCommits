AutoName: Ithaka Board Game
Description: |-
    ''Ithaka'' is played on a four by four square grid with three pieces in each of
    four colors. The pieces are initially arranged so that the three pieces of each
    color occupy a corner space and the two adjacent edge spaces.

    All of the pieces are shared by both players. Each player, in turn, moves one
    piece any number of spaces in a straight orthogonal or diagonal line over as
    many empty spaces as is desired, with the following restrictions:

    * The piece moved must not be the same piece moved on your opponent's most recent turn;
    * The piece moved must begin next to a piece of the same color;

    Win either by getting three pieces of one color in a row or by leaving your
    opponent with no available moves.
