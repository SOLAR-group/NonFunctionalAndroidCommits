AutoName: FiSSH
Description: |-
    [Note: The app is now developed under a new appID as <a href="https://f-droid.org/en/packages/ro.ioanm.fissh">FiSSH</a>]

    This Android app stores your SSH key phrase and sends it to your PC securely via the LAN when an authorized fingerprint is detected by the Android fingerprint scanner.

    * The PC must run Linux and have FiSSH desktop installed - see <a href="https://gitlab.com/ioanm/fissh-desktop/blob/master/INSTALL.md">INSTALL.md here</a>
    * The PC app then returns the received passphrase to OpenSSH and the standard ssh binary completes the login process.
    * It is important to note that none of the FiSSH apps have access to private key file and that FiSSH uses TLS sockets with certificate validation to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks!
