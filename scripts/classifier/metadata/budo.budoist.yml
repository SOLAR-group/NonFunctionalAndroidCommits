Description: |-
    Unofficial todoist.com (todo list management website) client. Neither the
    official apps nor the server are FOSS.

    * Offline support (syncs with Todoist servers)
    * Filter by projects, labels and queries
    * Sort items by due date
    * View and edit notes and labels
    * View completed items as well
    * Backup & restore Todoist data frequently
    * Many options for initial view (last used label/project, specific label/project, and many more)
    * Todoist text formatting for projects/items/notes (e.g. "my %(b)bold% item!")
    * Phone numbers, email and website addresses in items and notes are turned into clickable links
    * Support for uncompletable tasks (tasks with an asterisk at the beginning)

    Anti-feature: Network Services. The website itself is neither free-as-in-freedom
    nor open-source.
