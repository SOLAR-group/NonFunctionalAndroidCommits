AutoName: RasPi Check
Description: |-
    Show the user the current system status of a running Raspberry Pi computer. To
    gather the information needed, RasPi Check uses a SSH connection.

    RasPi Check shows you overclocking information (frequency, temperature, volts)
    and more system information (free memory, runtime, disk status). You can also
    restart or halt your Raspberry Pi Â® and send custom commands! If you always want
    to keep an eye on your Pi there's also a widget for your homescreen.

    All you need for the app to work are your SSH login credentials. You can either
    authentificate via password or via private/public key.
