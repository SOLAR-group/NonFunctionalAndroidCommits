Description: |-
    Minimal, simple and beautiful alarm clock thoughtfully designed by nap
    enthusiasts. It does only one function but does it well. Only one alarm time is
    supported and it’s recurring daily. Setting the new alarm time takes less than a
    second. To dismiss the alarm you can touch the screen anywhere which is handy if
    you are still sleepy and have barely opened your eyes. There is no snooze mode
    because you should be honest to yourself: if it’s time to wake up - go ahead!
