AutoName: Copy to Clipboard
Description: |-
    Copy to Clipboard integrates in to the Share menu, allowing you to copy text to
    the clipboard instead of sharing via an SMS/e-mail/tweet/etc.

    This is useful when you want to share text to an application that does not
    implement the regular "send to" functionality, such as GTalk.
