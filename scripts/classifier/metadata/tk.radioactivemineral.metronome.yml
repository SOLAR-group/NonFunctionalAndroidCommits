Description: |-
    Simple metronome app for musicians.

    This program was born out of my frustration to find a simple, elegant and useful
    metronome app, so my solution was simple: make what I want!

    In addition to being a simple BPM-based metronome, the program offers the
    ability to manually tap in a tempo and it also offers the option to save and
    restore presets.
