AutoName: adbWireless
Description: |-
    adbWireless lets you access your phone through adb without the need of a wired
    USB connection. The app provides you with the phoneâ€™s local IP address so that
    you can use it on your computer to connect to it. Beware, the access will be
    granted to all devices on the same wireless network - it would not be sensible
    to activate this service on any network that is not of your best trust.

    A simple toggle widget is included.
