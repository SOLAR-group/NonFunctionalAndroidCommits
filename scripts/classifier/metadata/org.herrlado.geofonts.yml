AutoName: Georgian Fonts Installer
Description: |-
    Install Georgian fonts if you don't have them already.

    Fonts have an AOSP base with added glyphs from
    <a href="http://dejavu-fonts.org/wiki/index.php?title=Besarion_Gugushvili">DejaVu</a>.
    Installation will overwrite the default fonts that you already have and make a
    backup of them.

    If it doesn't work maybe you don't have S-OFF or are currently using a
    non-default font. Reboot after installation. The suggested log application isn't
    free so use https://f-droid.org/packages/org.jtb.alogcat instead.

    Requires root: Yes. Android fonts are always located in /system
