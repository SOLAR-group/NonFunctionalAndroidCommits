Description: |-
    Primary is a slightly gamified educational application aimed at Primary
    (Elementary) school-aged children, but of course adults who wish to sharpen
    their skills will find it useful as well.  There are levels dealing with basic
    math, sorting, clocks, spelling, plurals, etc., with new subjects planned for
    the future.

    See the website for a full list of subjects and features.
