AutoName: Timidity AE
Description: |-
    Multimedia player focused on playing MIDI files. Instead of built-in Android
    MIDI playing features, it uses Timidity++ engine and allows specifying
    soundfonts and options. Included soundfont 8Rock11e seems to have non-free
    license "Distribute freely. Don't disassemble."

    Features include:

    * High quality MIDI file playback far superior to Android's built in Synth
    * Support for multiple user-set SoundFonts or patch sets
    * Multi-track mixer with support for per-track instrument and volume adjustment (only available for MIDI and MOD files)
    * Tempo, pitch, voice, and resampling controls
    * Create, save, and load custom instrument and volume configurations
    * Additional support for Amiga MOD files as well as the formats Android natively supports (mp3, ogg, flac, etc)
    * Export MIDI or MOD files to wav
    * Compressed .sfArk and .sfArk.exe SoundFont extraction
    * Notification with playback buttons (Honeycomb or later)
    * Folder and playlist based music organization
    * Dark and light themes
