AutoName: BlueGps
Description: |-
    Allows the connection of an external GPS tracker/mouse via bluetooth, injecting
    the location data as a “mock provider”. This can provide more accurate location
    than the build-in receiver (very useful for tracking in dense areas or in the
    woods, esp. for small tracks or streetaddresses etc), as well as make it
    possible to use GPS inside a car/boot, where the GPS receiver is mounted outside
    to get better reception.
