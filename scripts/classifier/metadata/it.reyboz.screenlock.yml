AutoName: Lock Screen
Description: |-
    This is not a custom "lock screen", but a shortcut to lock the screen.

    It is very appreciated for all the people who are afraid to destroy the physical
    lock button on their device. Most of them have even a kernel to unlock the phone
    without a physical key, and so with this app they will have their little key
    save for the eternity.

    Features:

    * Google Now gesture!
    * No other silly feature
