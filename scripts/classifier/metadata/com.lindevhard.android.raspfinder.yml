AutoName: RaspFinder
Description: |-
    RaspFinder will tell you the IP address of your RaspberryPi on your Wi-Fi network.
    RaspFinder helps you to find your device in case, when

    * you are not able to access your Raspberry directly
    * you can't browse your router for a connected devices list
    * you have your Raspberry at hand, but too lazy to connect it via HDMI or Ethernet

    All you need to care about - that the Raspberry and your smartphone are on the same network.

    '''Features:'''

    * quick search: within 2-3 secs
    * simple and intuitive interface
    * does not include advertising
    * low application weight
    * decent and modern design

    '''Attention:''' does NOT work if you are using MAC address spoofing!
