AutoName: SandwichRoulette
Description: |-
    SandwichRoulette is an application designed for the indecisive. Like many
    people, my lunch has been delayed because of my inability to decide on what to
    put in my sandwiches. This application, designed for Android-powered devices
    running 2.1 and higher, automates the ingredient choosing process. Creations can
    be saved and later versions will support sharing the particularly delicious
    ones.
