AutoName: Ship Captain and Crew
Description: |-
    A classic dice game for up to four players!

    This simple game requires a lot of luck and a very small amount of skill. In
    times past, this game was used as a gambling or drinking game by sailors and
    merchants alike. You must procure a ship (6), a captain (5), and a crew (4), the
    remainder is your cargo.

    Once you have your ship, captain, and crew, you can click on dice that you wish
    to hold in order to save them rather than roll them. You can also choose to keep
    them all if the conditions are right. The "point" or high score is always
    visible, and that is a big help to the "hammer" or the last player.

    This game is open source and add free! So grab a couple friends and set sail for
    high adventure with this fun little dice game. If your lucky, you may even
    strike "midnight"!
