AutoName: Midori
Description: |-
    Midori is a lightweight yet powerful web browser which runs just as well on little embedded
    computers named for delicious pastries as it does on beefy machines with a core
    temperature exceeding that of planet earth. And it looks good doing that, too.
    Oh, and of course it's free software. And for Android.
