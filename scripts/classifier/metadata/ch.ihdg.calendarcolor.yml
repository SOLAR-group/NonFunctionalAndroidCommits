AutoName: Calendar Color
Description: |-
    A simple app to change to color of a calendar in android 4+. Tested with
    calendars provided by baikal.

    '''Issues:'''

    The color is slightly different from what the google calendar app is showing.
    The google calendar app seems to tweak the colors a little bit. Colors set in
    owncloud are also slightly different in the google calendar app.

    The colorchanges back after some time: Many calendar services will overwrite the
    color when syncing. Set the color directly in the service (e.g. google,
    owncloud) instead.
