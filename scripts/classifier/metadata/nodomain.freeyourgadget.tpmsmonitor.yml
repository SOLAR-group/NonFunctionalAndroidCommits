AutoName: TpmsMonitor
Description: |
    TpmsMonitor allows to parse, show and store pressure and temperature as
    received by Bluetooth Low Energy tire pressure monitor sensors (TPMS).

    These sensors do not allow to establish a connection to other devices,
    but rather broadcast the readings as they see more fit (usually when a
    change in pressure or temperature is detected), requiring companion apps
    to just be listening for incoming messages.
