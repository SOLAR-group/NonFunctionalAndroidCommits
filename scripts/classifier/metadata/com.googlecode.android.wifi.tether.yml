AutoName: WiFi Tether
Summary: Wireless internet tethering
Description: |-
    '''N.B''' The app isn't built entirely from source; there are bunch of prebuilt
    programs like dnsmasq and iptables in the source code repository.

    This is the latest version of https://f-droid.org/packages/android.tether but it's still a beta.

    This program enables tethering (via WiFi and BT) for rooted handsets running
    Android. Clients (your laptop for example) can connect (via ad-hoc mode) and get
    access to the internet using the cellular data connection which is established
    by the handset.

    This application requires a rooted device (basic Android still doesn't allow
    ad-hoc mode) and (probably) a custom-kernel which supports netfilter (iptables).
    Please see the website for detailed information.
