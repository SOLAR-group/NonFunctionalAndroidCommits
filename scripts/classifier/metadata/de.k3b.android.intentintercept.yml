AutoName: Intent Intercept
Description: |-
    This app attempts to intercept as many intents as possible in order to examine
    their contents. This helps when trying to develop an app that reacts to a
    particular intent.

    Some details of the intent can now be edited before resending it.

    This app is forked from [https://github.com/intrications/intent-intercept]
    version 2.2.4,224 which is not maintained any more.
