AutoName: Free Klondike
Description: |
    Similarities to FreeCell:

    * The cards in the columns are always visible;
    * There are four individual cells at the top;

    Similarities to Klondike Solitaire:

    * There is a deck and discard pile to draw cards from;
    * Only Kings may be placed at the top of an empty column;
    * Cards may be removed from the Ace piles and placed back
    onto the playing field;
    * Any number of cards can be moved in one move (as long as
    they are stacked as in Klondike Solitaire;

    Features unique to this game:

    * The four individual cells start with cards in them;
    * You may only go through the deck twice on draw one and
    three times on draw three;
    * The obvious: there are only four columns, not 7 or 8 as
    in Klondike Solitaire and FreeCell, respectively;
