AutoName: SMS Forward
Description: |-
    SMS Forward is a simple app that allows you to redirect SMS.

    This application have been developed to bypass regional limitations. For
    example, a service in country A requires a phone number from country A,
    but your phone number is from country B. You ask a friend from country A
    to install this app and you will be able to receive SMS from the service
    in country B. However, since this is a pretty simple application, it can
    also serve other purposes.
