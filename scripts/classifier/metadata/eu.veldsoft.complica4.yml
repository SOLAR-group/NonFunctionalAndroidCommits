Description: |-
    ''Complica4'' is a modified version for four players of the game ''Complica,''
    which is similar to the game Connect Four. In Complica (not like in Connect
    Four), when a piece is placed, it does not remain there for the entire game.
    Another piece may be used to slide the entire row over. Winner is first person
    to have 4 pieces in a row. The mechanic of the sliding rows means that each
    player can possibly have 4 in a row at the same time, causing the game to
    continue until this situation can be broken up.
