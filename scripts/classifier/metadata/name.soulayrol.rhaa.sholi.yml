AutoName: ShoLi
Description: |-
    ShoLi aims at being a very simple tool to edit shopping lists, and then to be a
    support for checking on those very lists. It was heavily inspired by
    https://f-droid.org/packages/caldwell.ben.trolly which proposed a clean and efficient interface to
    achieve the same goal.

    ShoLi was only designed for small devices, the kind you can have in your pocket
    when you are doing your shopping. It runs on Android 4.x, and needs no external
    library, neither special permission.
