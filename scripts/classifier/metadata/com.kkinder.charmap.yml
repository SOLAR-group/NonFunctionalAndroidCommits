Description: |-
    A small and simple character picker, allowing you to copy and paste unicode
    characters, from Arabic to Ethiopic Extended. To copy multiple characters,
    enable the editor.

    Note, of course, that your deviceâ€™s font may not support all known characters.
    Characters that your device cannot render will most likely show up as empty
    rectangles, but they may still display elsewhere.
