AutoName: Colour Clock
Description: |-
    Tell the time with colours that change as they rotate round the clock face.
    Blobs at the end of the hour, minute, and second regions change colours over
    time (red = 12, yellow = 3, green = 6, blue = 9).

    This might help younger children to tell the time without having to know what
    numbers mean (e.g. it's yellow and orange).

    A sine-wave second "tick" has also been implemented, as well as fixing the
    minute hand to integer positions. This makes the clock a bit more interesting,
    because each hand tells the time in a different way.
