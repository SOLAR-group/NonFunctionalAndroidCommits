AutoName: Focal
Description: |-
    Fully featured camera app supporting as many devices as possiblee, including
    device-specific features on some devices.

    Features:

    * A photo and video mode, supporting many features (burst mode, timer mode, scene mode, shutter speed on Sony devices, ...)
    * A panorama mode, currently semi-broken
    * A PicSphere mode, open-source replacement of Google's PhotoSphere, to do 360Â° sphere shots
    * A review drawer, by sliding from the top of the screen (in portrait). It shows your latest pictures.

    In photo mode, you also have access to a few tools, such as automatic picture
    enhancement (auto-awesome), or a rule of thirds overlay. On some devices,
    settings such as Color adjustment, HDR and a manual light measure point are also
    available. Double tapping the screen will put your in quick shot mode, where
    tapping the screen anywhere will take a picture. In video mode, high-framerate
    video is also possible.
