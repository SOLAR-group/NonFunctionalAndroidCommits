AutoName: Deep Links for LabCoat
Description: |-
    Deep Links for LabCoat is a utility app that does one thing and only one
    thing: it allows you to open links to non-gitlab.com GitLab instances -
    for example, gitlab.gnome.org - in the ''LabCoat for GitLab'' app.

    '''Known issues:'''

    LabCoat opens but link does not load - Make sure you are signed in to an
    account on the Gitlab instance you are trying to access. LabCoat is
    unable to display anything from a Gitlab instance without a valid
    personal access token - even if the url you are trying to access is public
    on the web.
