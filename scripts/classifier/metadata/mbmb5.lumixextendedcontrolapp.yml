Description: |-
    Aims at extending lumix camera abilities. Eylca currently allows to shoot
    pictures or to record a video when a motion is detected in what the camera sees.
    This application is unofficial. It is not an official Panasonic product, and it
    is not approved by or associated with Panasonic in any way. For basic camera
    control over wifi, please use the official app instead.  Please note that it is
    only tested on the FZ1000, but it should work on most Lumix cameras.
