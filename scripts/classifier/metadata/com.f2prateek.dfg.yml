AutoName: Device Frame Generator
Description: |-
    The device frame generator allows you to quickly wrap your app screenshots in
    real device artwork, providing better context for your screenshots. You can
    generate screenshots through sharing in Android, as well as perform batch
    operations.

    This app will no longer be updated; Upstream started using proprietary libraries
    heavily.
