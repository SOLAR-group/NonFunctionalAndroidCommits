Description: |-
    The privacy friendly Finance Manager helps you keep track of your income
    and expenses. The app offers the following features:

    '''New transactions'''

    You can create new expenses by clicking on the Plus-Button in the bottom
    right corner in the main view. Now you can enter the amount, a title, a
    date and a category. Furthermore, you can specify if the transaction is an
    expense or income.

    '''Transaction overview'''

    In the main view you are able to see the total balance of your
    transactions, as well as a list with all transactions you entered. By
    long-clicking on the entry you can either edit or delete the transaction.

    '''Categories'''

    Under the menu item “Categories” you can see all the categories you created
    and their total balances, depending on the transactions that are labelled
    with the respective category. By clicking on the Plus-Button in the bottom
    right corner you can create new Categories. By long-clicking on the entry
    you can either edit or delete the category.

    The app belongs to the Privacy Friendly Apps group developed by the
    research group SECUSO at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology.
