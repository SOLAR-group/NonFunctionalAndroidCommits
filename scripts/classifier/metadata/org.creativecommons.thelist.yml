AutoName: The List
Description: |-
    '''Note:''' this app is no longer maintained, its repo was archived.

    No one can be everywhere at once. But everyone can.

    NGOs, journalists, government agencies, and cultural institutions all need
    photographs to tell their story and educate others. But there’s no way for those
    organizations to be in the right place at the right time, every time. That’s
    where we come in.

    Through The List, organizations will provide lists of locations, people, and
    events that they need photographs of. And when users are in the right place at
    the right time, they can claim an item from the list and publish a photograph of
    it. All photos on The List are openly licensed, meaning that everyone can use
    them.
