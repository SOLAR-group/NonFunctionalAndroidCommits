AutoName: Haven
Summary: Protect personal spaces and possessions without compromising privacy
Description: |
    Haven is for people who need a way to protect their personal spaces
    and possessions without compromising their own privacy. It is an
    Android application that leverages on-device sensors to provide
    monitoring and protection of physical spaces. Haven turns any Android
    phone into a motion, sound, vibration and light detector, watching
    for unexpected guests and unwanted intruders. We designed Haven for
    investigative journalists, human rights defenders, and people at risk
    of forced disappearance to create a new kind of herd immunity. By
    combining the array of sensors found in any smartphone, with the
    world’s most secure communications technologies, like Signal and Tor,
    Haven prevents the worst kind of people from silencing citizens
    without getting caught in the act.

    Project Team

    Haven was developed through a collaboration between Freedom of the
    Press Foundation and Guardian Project. Prototype funding was
    generously provided by FoPF, and donations to support continuing work
    can be contributed through their site:
    https://freedom.press/donate-support-haven-open-source-project

    Safety through Sensors

    Haven only saves images and sound when triggered by motion or volume,
    and stores everything locally on the device. You can position the
    device’s camera to capture visible motion, or set your phone
    somewhere discreet to just listen for noises. Get secure
    notifications of intrusion events instantly and access the logs
    remotely or anytime later.

    The follow sensors are monitored for a measurable change, and then
    recorded to an event log on the device:

    * Accelerometer: phone’s motion and vibration
    * Camera: motion in the phone’s visible surroundings from front or back camera
    * Microphone: noises in the enviroment
    * Light: change in light from ambient light sensor
    * Power: detect device being unplugged or power loss
