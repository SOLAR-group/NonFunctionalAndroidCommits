    The app makes use of an <a href="http://dev.npr.org">API</a> and you should observe the
    <a href="http://www.npr.org/about-npr/179876898/terms-of-use">terms</a> if you are
    considering making a derivative â€” in particular, only non-commercial use is
    allowed.

    Status: There isn't any source for the current version so we built from the
    latest available. Bugs are included, especially to do with the location aspect
    so you might want to disable GPS while using.
