Description: |-
    Play Go games on [http://online-go.com]. The app is still early in development
    so be prepared for bugs and half-implemented features.

    The main reason to use this over the website is the ability to have the first
    click zoom the board so that the stones can be placed with more accuracy. This
    allows 19x19 games to be easily played on even a small screen such as a phone.
